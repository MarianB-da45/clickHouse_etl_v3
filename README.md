# Divy_Trips_tripdata 

Divy Trips is a fictitious cab hailing company in New York City. Divy has been collecting individual trip data from 2009 to 2016. The data is large and is stored in a clickhouse database (https://github.demo,trial.altinity.cloud:8443/play). The business seeks to generate monthly aggregated data and load in a DWH to
facilitate business analytics and informed decision-making.

## Project
 You have been hired as a data engineer, and your first task is to orchestrate a pipeline to achieve this objective. You are to use modular coding and appropriate version control for the solution you develop, to facilitate code maintenance, and collaboration with your future team members.

## Tasks
• ﻿﻿Explore the trip data on Clickhouse
• ﻿﻿Extract the trip data and load to a staging area on an on-prem database.
• ﻿﻿Create a production environment and develop procedures to load aggregate tables to show the following monthly metrics (average trip count, average trip duration, average trip fare)
• ﻿﻿Push your code to a new Github repository,
• ﻿﻿Pull the codebase from the github repository.
• ﻿﻿Create a branch and refactor the code to load data incrementally and implement an orchestration to load the data daily.
• ﻿﻿Commit your changes to your branch and create a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch (codebase).
• ﻿﻿Orchestrate the incremental load pipeline using Windows task Scheduler.
